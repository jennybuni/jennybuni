# Covid Maybe?

So yesterday I got a message.. well a alot of messages from work, it turns out many of them have tested positive. *sighs loudly* as some of you may know I'm really scared of getting covid, i dont exsactly have the best record with my health or my body have ability to fight off any viruses.

So what did i do with my day yesterday, well i managed to get started and learn how to get this blog started, i know most people have blogs and never post to them but i want to try to use this place as a diary, even if its only me who ever reads it.
